# Proof of Concept
After thinking about the Akademia Albania project, I decided to create first a proof of concept before spending lots of time on a project which depends on many factors and alot of work to reach its success. Check here about the first part [this][akd-web]. Today I can finally present the first designs of the page:

As you can also see partly from the text on the header, the inspiration for this kind of style came from https://ducksboard.com/.
After some styling, adding FontAwesome for icons and adding, most importantly, the content needed for the landing page, the result is as below:

With the landing page finished, soon the Mission Statement, Courses and Lecture designs will follow. After that, the only thing remaining would be some content and then people, who would use it and see the good/bad parts of the project.
