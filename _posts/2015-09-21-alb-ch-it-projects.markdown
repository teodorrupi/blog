## IT in Albania

The Albanian IT industry is growing daily due to investments but the quality is really low and most of the investments go in developing unused technologies. Due to low competition, the best Albanian companies do little work, get huge funds and produce low quality end-products which most of the time are mandatory to use in government offices.

A competitor product in Albania would win with very little effort, and some nice (cool) design. Especially a product which is said to be from a foreign more advanced country, i.e Germany.

Some of the strongest points to compete in the Albanian market are **Apps**(Entertainment with low cost), **Education**(Professional free education to give practical skills instead of general learning material) and **Finance** , **Automation**(on anything basically would be a huge advancement) and **Quality Assurance** (not so profitable or popular unless set as a standard in the near future for Albanian IT products).

Motivational context would be to simply check the government websites, where the “latest achievements and products” do not even work and everything seems to be implemented from a non-professional high school student while doing his computer homework without even using a computer.

## Idea

Since the majority of youth struggles to get the necessary learning material to harness new skills in their field of interest, creating a learning platform in albanian is a huge help to provide free education. Being based on only what the industry needs, it can give anyone willing to learn the tools for a better career.

To do so, at the moment, I am building **Akademia Albania**, a web application which basically will provide video tutorials and scripted information in Albanian. This video provider will follow the progress and engagement of its users, make them aware of industry needs and career opportunities. 

The project is still under development, but is already coming up pretty well. Based on Angularjs MVC architecture and a java Spring RESTful backend, is fast, easy to build, and stable.

## Techs

The technology stack behind the idea will have the following structure:
- A database layer will provide video and page informations
- The RESTful service will take care to serve the following based on any query
- Angularsjs MVC architecture will build views through the data provided by the RESTful webservice

## Resouces
Check out what I will be using:

- Webapp level, using `Angularjs Model-View-Control` architecture https://angularjs.org/
- Template Generation level, using `Jade` (Javascript) http://jade-lang.com/ or `Thymeleaf` (Java) http://www.thymeleaf.org/
- Webservice level, using `Spring RESTful` https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/
- Database level, using `MongoDB` https://www.mongodb.org/
