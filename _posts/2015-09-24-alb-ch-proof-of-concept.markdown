description: Applying proof of concept on Akademia Albania
---

# Akademia Albania
Being a good or even perfect idea, does not necessarily mean that the project will have an audience fit for its vision or even bigger. And investing time and resources on a project which might fail due to no market insights its not a really good idea. Check [this][akd-web] other post on the idea itself and its implementation.

# Project Limits
This projects success is based on 3 major factors:
- The tech stack to make the project exist
- The content availability and quality, in this case info, videos and tutorials which are the core of the idea
- The audience in need of this service and their interest in it

Investing a huge time on the technological stack, will lower the quality of the other 2 factors due to time consumption and driven from the idea of rolling out as soon as possible. On the other hand, having a very bad platform with a non functional backend is not much of a good project even if the content is there and ready to be served. In the third case, after spending so much time on having a nicely developed idea with great content, what if the market is not ready for it and does not want or need it? 

So, as a conclusion, none and all the steps at the same time are worth to be researched and improved on. But what if you are low on resources, people and time?

# Proof of Concept
The idea is to prove to yourself and team that the project is worth it and it has some future and oportunities of expansion. To create a proof of concept for Akademia Albania we decided to shift from the Angularjs MongoDB stack with a RESTful service as a backed to simply Jekyll. Fast to set up, perfect for a small project and already has a broad support on implementation. Is this scalable? Of course not. Is Jekyll really useful for this kind of projects? Not at all, especially since its based on static web and has no backed what so ever. But instead of basing your research on how the product will come out on a mockup, you can create a "mockup" like static website and have the first insights on what has to be changed or fixed. You can already see where you limitations are and if these limitations would affect your "real" architecture.

# Development Stage
For the development stage, first we will start by having a look at Jekyll themes. Easy and free to build and run wherever you want, ready to publish in minutes with the help of Github Pages. Then the theme will be edited to the needs of the project, mainly styling and additional pages, since most Jekyll themes are for blog based applications.
Adding Google Analytics and doing some marketing on the side in social networks like Facebook, Google Plus and Twitter will in a short time give you the opportunity to measure the real impact your application has in the market.

# Timeline
THe project is scheduled to be ready by the end of this week, then the content creation stage starts. In parallel, marketing must start, which could also be through SEO. Next update will be on the initial styles of the project.
