#About me
Hi. My name is Teodor and I am a **Quality Assurance Automation Engineer** at [trivago][trivago-site]. I am from Albania, but live in Dusseldorf, Germany. I graduated with a Bachelors degree from [Jacobs University Bremen][jacobs-uni-link], majoring in **Electrical Engineering and Computer Science**.

#Work
My daily routine is related to programming, mostly in Java and JavaScript, building Android applications on the side on my free time.
